# bubble-sort
Just learning Python.
The program "Bubble sorting" in Python. 
For clarity, it implements the output of step-by-step array changes.

Sorting from smaller to larger.

1. Create a list of five numbers arranged randomly.
2. Create a binary value to store the sorting result.
3. In the loop, for each iteration of the algorithm, set the binary value as true, run the element comparison cycle.
4. In the comparison loop, for each element of the array, we compare this element with the one to the right of it.
5. If the element on the left is larger than the element on the right, we swap them and set the binary value as untrue.
6. If the binary value is true, output the result and finish.
7. In another case, we repeat the iteration of the algorithm.
